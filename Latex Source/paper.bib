  abstract   = {College students often listen to music while they use a computer. This experiment investigated whether background music disrupts their ability to word process fluently and effectively. Forty-five psychology undergraduates wrote brief expository essays. Background music significantly disrupted writing fluency (words generated per minute controlling for typing speed and including those words deleted before the final draft) even though no response to the music was required. Those with some musical training and high working memory span wrote better essays with longer sentences and were also more likely to pause at clause boundaries. Even unattended music places heavy demands on working memory and disrupts word processed writing.},

  abstract = {This study examined the effects of vocal and instrumental music upon the performance of introverts and extraverts on three cognitive tasks. In the presence of either vocal or instrumental music, or in silence, introverts and extraverts sixth form pupils (N=144) completed a reading comprehension, a logic problem and a coding task. An interaction was predicted such that instrumental music would impair and enhance the test performance of introverts and extraverts, respectively, and that these effects would be magnified in the vocal music condition. No significant interactions were found, although there was a trend for the introverts to be impaired by the introduction of music to the environment and extraverts to be enhanced by it, particularly on the reading and coding tasks. A main effect of extraversion was found in the reading comprehension task and nearly in the coding task (p<0.06). There was a condition effect on the logic task with subjects doing best in the presence of instrumental music. Experimental explanations for the lack of predicted interactions are offered. These findings are discussed with respect to Eysencks theory of personality [Eysenck, H. (1967). The biological basis of personality. Springfield, IL: Thomas.].}

  abstract = {Abstract Previous research has found that the performance of introverts on complex cognitive tasks is more negatively affected by distracters, e.g. music and background noise, than the performance of extraverts. The present study extends previous research by examining whether or not background noise would prove to be as distracting as music. In the presence of silence, background UK garage music and background noise, 118 female secondary school students carried out three cognitive tests. It was predicted that introverts would do less well on all of the tasks than extraverts in the presence of music and noise but in silence performance would be the same. A significant interaction was found on all three of the tasks. It was also predicted that there would be a main effect of background sound: Performance would be worse in the presence of music and noise than silence. Results confirmed this prediction with one exception. This study also found a positive correlation between extraversion and intelligence, the implications of which are also discussed. The findings support the Eysenckian hypothesis of the difference in optimum cortical arousal in introverts and extraverts. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},
